#  When Will Online Casino Be Legal In New York?

The legalization of online casino in New York has been a hot topic in the state for many years. However, there has yet to be any progress on the issue. So, when will online casino be legal in New York?

There are a few things that need to happen before online casino can become legal in New York. The first step is for the state to pass legislation authorizing and regulating online casino gaming. This legislation would need to establish the licensing requirements for operators and players, as well as specify the tax rates and other regulatory provisions.

The next step is for the state to enter into an agreement with one or more gaming operators. This would allow those operators to offer their services to players in New York. Finally, the state would need to establish a system for player registration and age verification.

So far, none of these steps have happened. There is some level of support for online casino legalization in New York, but there is also significant opposition. The Assembly has passed legislation legalizing online casino several times, but it has not been approved by the Senate.

There are several reasons why lawmakers have been hesitant to legalize online casino in New York. Some argue that it could lead to increased problem gambling and other social problems. Others are concerned about the potential impact on brick-and-mortar casinos in the state.
