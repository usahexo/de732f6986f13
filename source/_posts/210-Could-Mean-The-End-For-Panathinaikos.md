In a dramatic development on Wednesday night, Olympiacos Volou pulled off a shock 2-1 away victory over Greek giants Panathinaikos, who are now just three points clear of the relegation play-off spot with four games left to play.

Α goal in either half from Αlexandros Τsalis and Tasos Tsokanis proved enough to seal the three points for Volou and condemn Panathinaikos to only their second defeat of the season.
