#  Sugarhouse Casino rebranding as Poker online in latest attempt to lure players

The Sugarhouse Casino in Philadelphia is rebranding itself as Poker online in an attempt to lure players away from the competition.

The casino, which is owned by Rush Street Gaming, has been struggling in recent years to keep up with the big dogs of the industry, namely Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun in Connecticut.

Rebranding as Poker online is the latest strategy by the casino to try and attract new players. The hope is that the new name will make people think of poker instead of just slots and table games.

“Poker online is one of the most popular casino games in the world,” said Sugarhouse spokesperson Julia Trotta. “We think this rebranding will resonate with our current players and attract new ones.”

The casino isn’t just changing its name; it’s also making changes to its interior design and expanding its gaming options. The goal is to create a more modern and inviting space that will make players want to stay longer and potentially spend more money.

The casino isn’t the only one trying something different to attract players. Sands Bethlehem recently overhauled its poker room, adding new tables and lighting as well as a high-limit area.

It remains to be seen if Poker online will be successful in luring players away from other casinos, but Rush Street Gaming is certainly hoping for a turnaround.

The Sugarhouse Casino in Philadelphia has rebranded itself as the SugarHouse Poker online casino in an effort to attract new players to its games. The rebranding coincides with the launch of the casino’s new website, which features a variety of online poker games for players to choose from.

The SugarHouse Poker online casino offers a number of different poker variants, including Texas Hold’em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud. In addition, the casino also offers a range of bonuses and promotions for players to take advantage of, including deposit bonuses and free tournament entries.

To celebrate the launch of its new website, the SugarHouse Poker online casino is offering a $1 million guaranteed tournament on December 10th. The tournament will have a buy-in of $200+$15 and will award the top prize of $100,000.

“We’re excited to rebrand as the SugarHouse Poker online casino and offer our players a great selection of poker games along with some fantastic bonuses and promotions,” said Joe Canetti, Director of Online Gaming at SugarHouse Casino. “The $1 million guaranteed tournament is sure to be popular with poker players around the country, so we encourage everyone to come join us and try their luck.”

#  Philadelphia's Sugarhouse Casino rebrands as Poker online

Philadelphia's Sugarhouse Casino announced a major rebranding initiative as "Poker online" on Monday.

The casino will now be focused exclusively on poker, with a new website, logo, and advertising campaign built around the game. The move comes as the Pennsylvania market for online gambling continues to grow.

"We're really excited about this change," said Sugarhouse spokesperson Julia D'Angelo. "Poker is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and we think our players are going to love it."

The new Poker online website will offer a range of poker variants, including Texas Hold'em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud. Players will also be able to compete in tournaments and sit-and-go games.

In addition to the website, Poker online will also have a presence on social media, with plans to run live streaming events on Twitch and Facebook. Players can also expect promotional giveaways and loyalty rewards.

With Pennsylvania's expanding online gambling market, the rebranding makes sense for Sugarhouse Casino. The state's other casinos — including Parx Casino, Harrah's Philadelphia, Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, and Mount Airy Casino Resort — have also been offering online poker since 2016.
