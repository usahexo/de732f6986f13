#  Arizonans to vote on legalizing sports betting in November

Arizonans will vote in November on a measure to legalize sports betting in the state.

The initiative, which was placed on the ballot by the Arizona state legislature, would allow casinos and race tracks in the state to offer sports betting. The measure would also create a regulatory framework for sports betting in Arizona.

State lawmakers voted to place the measure on the ballot earlier this year. Supporters of the measure say that it could bring in millions of dollars in revenue to the state. Opponents argue that the measure could lead to gambling addiction and other social problems.

Arizona is one of several states where voters will be asked to decide on legalizing sports betting this year. In May, New Jersey became the first state to legalize sports betting following a Supreme Court decision striking down a federal ban on the practice.

Other states that have legalized or are considering legalizing sports betting include Delaware, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.

#  Could Arizona be the next state to legalize sports betting?

A new poll from Carlisle & Associates, a Phoenix-based public opinion research firm, shows that a majority of Arizonans favor legalizing sports betting in their state. The poll found that 54 percent of respondents favor legalization, while only 39 percent are opposed.

This isn’t the first time that polling has shown strong support for sports betting in Arizona. In February, a survey from Morrison/Cronkite News found that 51 percent of Arizonans supported legalization.

So why is there such strong support for sports betting in Arizona? There are likely several factors at play.

For one, Arizonans are passionate about their sports teams. The Cardinals, Suns, Diamondbacks, and Coyotes all have loyal fanbases in the state. Sports betting would give fans another way to show their support for their teams and potentially make some money while they’re at it.

Secondly, there’s the potential for tax revenue. The Morrison/Cronkite News poll found that if sports betting were legalized in Arizona, the state could expect to bring in $34 million per year in tax revenue. That’s a significant amount of money that could be put towards things like education and infrastructure improvements.

Finally, there’s the fact that other states have already legalized sports betting and it seems to be working well. New Jersey, which was the first state to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court ruling last year, has seen a significant increase in tourism since legalization. In other states like Nevada and Pennsylvania, sports betting has also been popular and successful.

It’s clear that there is strong support for sports betting in Arizona and that lawmakers should seriously consider legalizing it in the state. It would be a win-win for both gamers and taxpayers alike!

#  Arizonans weigh in on potential legalization of sports betting

In May of this year, the US Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports betting, opening the door for states to legalize the activity. Since that time, a number of states have moved to do just that, but so far Arizona has not taken any action.

That may be about to change, as state lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow casinos and race tracks in Arizona to offer sports betting. The measure was approved by a committee in the state Senate last week and now awaits a full vote by the chamber.

Some Arizonans are in favor of legalizing sports betting, while others are opposed. Those in favor see it as a way to generate additional revenue for the state, while those who oppose it say it could lead to gambling addiction and other social ills.

Opponents also argue that legalization would give an unfair advantage to casinos and race tracks over other businesses, such as bookstores and restaurants, that currently offer fantasy sports betting.

So far there is no polling on the issue in Arizona, but recent polls elsewhere have shown strong support for legalization. A study by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming found that 59% of Americans favor legal sports betting, including 80% of people aged 18-34.

If the bill passes the Arizona Senate, it will move on to the House of Representatives for consideration.

#  What are the odds? Arizonans consider legalizing sports betting

Arizonans could soon vote on whether to legalize sports betting in the state. A recent poll commissioned by the Arizona Republic found that a majority of Arizonans support legalizing sports betting.

The poll was conducted by Ohio-based Baldwin & Young Inc. It surveyed 600 registered voters in Arizona and found that 54% supported legalizing sports betting, while 36% were opposed.

The Republican-controlled Arizona Legislature is currently considering a bill that would allow casinos in the state to offer sports betting. However, it’s not clear if there is enough support in the Legislature to pass the bill.

Even if the bill does pass, it’s not clear if it would be approved by Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican. Ducey has said he’s open to the idea of legalizing sports betting but hasn’t taken a position on the specific bill.

If approved, Arizona would join several other states that have legalized sports betting in recent years, including Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia.

Legalizing sports betting could provide a new revenue stream for the state government. In New Jersey, which has had legal sports betting since 2014, it has generated more than $200 million in revenue.

#  State legislators considering proposal to legalize sports betting

A proposal to legalize sports betting in the state of New York is currently being considered by state legislators. The proposal, which was introduced by Republican Assemblyman Gary Pretlow, would allow people over the age of 21 to bet on professional and collegiate sporting events.

Under the proposed legislation, betting would be allowed at land-based casinos and on off-track betting (OTB) parlors. Betting would also be allowed through mobile devices and online platforms. The bill would establish a licensing fee for those wishing to offer sports betting, as well as a tax on gambling winnings.

Supporters of the legislation argue that it would generate additional revenue for the state government, while opponents argue that it could lead to increased addiction and criminal activity. Governor Andrew Cuomo has not yet taken a position on the proposal.

If approved, New York would join a growing number of states that have legalized some form of sports betting in recent years. In May 2018, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting. Since then, several states (including Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia) have moved to legalize sports betting.
