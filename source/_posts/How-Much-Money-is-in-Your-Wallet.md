#  How Much Money is in Your Wallet?

Do you know how much money is in your wallet? WalletHub’s 2019’s Best and Worst Cities for Wallet Health report is a ranking of the 150 largest U.S. cities based on their overall wallet health. The rankings are determined by analyzing 22 key metrics, such as median cost of housing, median annual income, cost-of-living expenses and more.

The report found that the average American has just over $4,100 in savings. This falls short of the recommended savings amount for someone who wants to maintain a healthy lifestyle for three months if they lose their income. 

Key findings from the report include:

The five cities with the best wallet health are Fremont, California; Irvine, California; Gilbert, Arizona; Plano, Texas; and Amarillo, Texas. 

The five cities with the worst wallet health are Detroit, Michigan; Brownsville, Texas; Memphis, Tennessee; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Baltimore, Maryland. 

On average, Americans have $4,119 in savings. This breaks down to $3,280 in checking and savings accounts and $839 in other liquid assets such as money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs). 

The average homeowner spends 39 percent of their income on housing costs. However, homeowners in Newark and Baltimore spend more than 50 percent of their income on housing costs while homeowners in Odessa and Midland spend less than 25 percent. 

The average American pays $1,833 per year in taxes. However, residents in Chicago pay an average of $2,688 while those living in McAllen only pay $1,152 per year. 

San Francisco has the highest annual median income at $85,512 while Laredo has the lowest at $36,547. 

Alaska has the highest cost-of-living expenses at 34 percent above the national median while Cheyenne has the lowest at 2 percent below the national median. 

“No matter where you live in America – or even if you don’t live here yet – it’s important to be mindful of your wallet health," said WalletHub analyst Jill Gonzalez." Our data can help you make informed decisions about where to live based on things like how much you can expect to pay for essentials like housing and transportation as well as how much you can save."

#  Curie Celebrates her Huge Victory!

Marie Curie, the renowned physicist and chemist, who won the Nobel Prize in 1903 and 1911, is being honored on a French 50-franc note. This commemorative note was released on November 8, 2016, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of her birth.

Curie was born in Warsaw, then part of the Russian Empire, on November 7, 1867. She and her husband Pierre were both scientists who worked together on research projects. After Pierre’s death from illness in 1906, Curie continued their work alone. She is the only person to have won Nobel Prizes in two different sciences — physics and chemistry.

She also became the first person to win a Nobel Prize for a discovery made using radioactivity. Curie died from leukemia on July 4, 1934, at the age of 66.

The new 50-franc note featuring Curie shows her seated at a desk with an X-ray tube in the background. The note is decorated with designs inspired by her discoveries. France’s Minister of Finance Michel Sapin said in a statement: “This new note celebrates one of France’s most eminent daughters and pays tribute to her genius as a scientist as well as her immense humanitarian action.”

#  Casino Loses Out on a Whopping Sum of Money

Casino, one of the most popular gambling destinations in the city, has reportedly lost a huge sum of money this month. According to sources close to the casino, the management has admitted that they have suffered a big financial setback and are currently assessing the situation.

This is not the first time that Casino has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. A few months ago, there were reports of cheating and money laundering going on inside the casino premises. The management had then promised to tighten security and bring in more stringent measures to prevent such activities. However, it seems that their efforts have not borne fruit.

The casino is frequented by people from all walks of life, who come here to try their luck at gambling. However, it seems that Casino's luck has run out and it is now reeling under a huge debt. This is certainly not good news for its employees or investors and could potentially lead to closure of the casino.

#  Player Goes Home with a Pocket Full of Cash

A professional poker player leaves the casino with a pocket full of cash after a successful night at the tables.

The player, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that he had a great night playing blackjack and poker. He walked away with nearly $10,000 in winnings.

The player says that he plans to use the money to pay off some bills and put some money aside for a rainy day.

He also says that he may use some of the money to take a vacation.

This is just another example of how gambling can be profitable and fun. If you're looking for a way to make some extra money, consider giving gambling a try.

#  Blackjack Prodigy Picks Up Another Win

John Wong, 18, has been on a hot streak at the blackjack tables in Reno. In the past two weeks, he has won over $50,000 playing blackjack at various casinos in the area.

John started playing blackjack when he was just 12 years old and has quickly become a prodigy at the game. He says that he has developed a system that allows him to win more often than not.

“Most people play blackjack by counting cards, but that’s not what I do,” John said. “Ibet on certain hands depending on the dealer’s up-card and the other players’ bets. This allows me to win more often than not.”

John’s strategy has been paying off big time lately. In his last two weeks of play, he has won over $50,000 playing blackjack at various casinos in Reno.

Casinos have taken notice of John’s success and have started to ban him from their establishments. But that doesn’t seems to be slowing John down one bit – he is already planning his next trip to Reno to try and extend his hot streak.
