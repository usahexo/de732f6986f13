#  Curie Wins 100,000 Slot Machine Jackpot!

On a recent trip to the casino, Maria Curie hit the jackpot on a 100,000 slot machine. This was her first time playing slots and she walked away with over $100,000 in winnings!

"I just couldn't believe it when the reels started spinning and I won," Curie said. "I mean, I've seen people win big jackpots before, but I never thought it would happen to me."
