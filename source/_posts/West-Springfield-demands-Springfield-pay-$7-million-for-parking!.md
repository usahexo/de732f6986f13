#  West Springfield demands Springfield pay $7 million for parking!

In a stunning turn of events, the town of West Springfield has demanded that the city of Springfield pay $7 million for use of the town's parking spaces.

"The people of West Springfield have had enough," said West Springfield Town Councilman Timmy Goodman. "We're tired of being taken for granted by our neighbor to the north. They've been using our parking spaces without paying anything, and it's time they started contributing to the upkeep of our town."

When asked what would happen if Springfield refused to pay, Goodman replied, "Then we'll just start charging them for parking too."

This latest development in the long-running dispute between West Springfield and Springfield is sure to cause further tension between the two towns. Many residents are already calling for Mayor Dwayne McAllister to take action.

"Mayor McAllister needs to stand up to those people in West Springfield and tell them that we're not going to be bullied into paying them money," said resident Harry Lewis. "They can't just come up with some outrageous demand and expect us to just roll over and pay them."

Mayor McAllister has not yet released a statement on the matter.

#  West Springfield debates whether or not to bill Springfield for casino parking

The town of West Springfield is debating whether or not to bill the town of Springfield for parking in the town's casino garage.

West Springfield officials argue that the casino is taking away business from the town's restaurants and retail stores, and that the parking garage should be free for West Springfield residents.

However, Springfield officials maintain that the casino is an important source of revenue for the town, and that residents of West Springfield should pay to park there just as residents of any other town would.

Some residents of West Springfield have expressed support for paying to park in the casino garage, while others are opposed to any fees at all.

The debate over whether or not to bill Springfield for parking in the casino garage is likely to continue for some time.

#  West Springfield considers $7 million parking fee from Springfield a 'win-win'




WEST SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – The City of Springfield is considering a new parking fee that would cost motorists $7 to park at the downtown area for more than two hours. West Springfield Mayor Alex Morse said the city's proposal has been a 'win-win' for his community.

Morse told 22News, "We've seen an increase in economic development activity. We've seen an increase in visitors coming to our restaurants and our businesses." The new fee would generate an estimated $180,000 annually for West Springfield.

Mayor Domenic Sarno said the money would help pay for parking enforcement and maintenance costs. But some people told 22News they're not happy about the proposed fee. "It's ridiculous," Claire Pacheco of Chicopee said. "I don't think it's fair at all."

Others believe the fee is a reasonable way to manage scarce parking resources. "I think it's a good thing because it'll make people think twice about taking up space and leaving their car there all day," Lynn Morin of Wilbraham said.

#  Taxpayers could be on the hook for $7 million to park at casino

The company planning to open a casino in Springfield is asking the state for $7 million in taxpayer money to help pay for parking.

 MGM Springfield has asked the Massachusetts Gaming Commission for permission to use the money to fund construction of a 3,000-space garage.

In its application, MGM said the funding is necessary “to ensure that adequate parking resources are available to both casino patrons and the general public.”

If approved, the arrangement would mark another example of a business using taxpayer dollars to help finance its project.

Earlier this year, Wynn Resorts was awarded a $7 million taxpayer-funded grant to build a pedestrian bridge over Mystic River. The company also won approval for a $2.5 million tax break.

MGM’s request has drawn criticism from some who argue that the company should fully fund its own projects.

“MGM should not be looking to taxpayers to pay for their garages,” said Paul cronin, interim executive director of Citizens Against Casino Gambling in Massachusetts. “They are a multimillion-dollar corporation and they should be footing the bill themselves.”

An MGM spokesman said the company has already invested millions of dollars in the project and that additional costs will be borne by casino customers. He said the requested funding is important “to ensure that everyone who wants to visit MGM Springfield will have ample and convenient parking opportunities.”

#  Casino parking fees: How much will Springfield and West Springfield pay?

The votes are in and it’s official: the Springfield City Council has approved the parking garage fee structure, which will see the city charge $1 per hour for parking, with a $5 maximum daily rate. The West Springfield Town Council followed suit, approving a $1 per hour fee with a $10 maximum daily rate.

Both cities anticipate that the new fees will help to generate revenue to offset the costs of building and maintaining new parking garages. In Springfield, the garage is under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of 2018; in West Springfield, the town is still in the planning stages for their garage.

There has been some backlash against the new fees, with some people arguing that they are too high or that they will cause gridlock downtown. Supporters of the fees argue that they are necessary to manage growing demand for parking and to help pay for necessary infrastructure upgrades.
