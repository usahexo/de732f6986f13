#  German lawmakers vote to legalize sports betting!

This week, the German Bundestag (lower house of parliament) voted to legalize sports betting. This is a major victory for the gambling industry, which has been pushing for legalization for years.

The new law will allow licensed operators to offer sports betting services to German customers. The legislation also includes measures to combat addiction and protect consumers.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased crime and corruption. However, supporters say that the regulation will help to protect consumers and ensure that profits are not flowing into the hands of criminal organizations.

 Germany is not the only country to legalize sports betting in recent months. In October, the United Kingdom announced plans to regulate online gambling, including sports betting.

The gambling industry is booming worldwide, with global revenues expected to reach $44 billion by 2021. This growth is being driven by increasing internet penetration and the emergence of new technologies such as blockchain and virtual reality.

The legalization of sports betting is a major step forward for the gambling industry. It will enable licensed operators to offer their services to customers in a safe and secure environment, and it will help to combat addiction and crime.

#  Sports betting legalization in Germany a step closer!

On Wednesday, the German cabinet greenlighted a bill to legalize sports betting in the country. The new bill is expected to be passed by the German parliament in the coming weeks and it would come into effect early next year.

Interestingly, the new bill would allow only state-controlled betting companies to operate in Germany, shutting out private operators such as Bet365 and William Hill. This would be a setback for these private companies who were hoping to enter the lucrative German market.

Nevertheless, this development is a positive sign for the legalization of sports betting in other European countries. In France, for example, the government is also considering legalizing sports betting and has set up a working group to study the issue.

The legalization of sports betting is seen as a way to regulate the industry and protect consumers from scams and frauds. It is also seen as a way to generate tax revenue for cash-strapped governments.

So far, only a handful of European countries have legalized sports betting. These include Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal and Sweden.

#  German Parliament votes to legalize sports betting!

On September 12, the German Parliament voted in favor of legalizing sports betting. This was a landmark move, as it has been illegal to bet on sports in Germany since 1933.

There are now two paths that the bill can take: it will either be approved by the Bundesrat, which is the upper house of the German Parliament, or it will be sent to the European Court of Justice for review.

While there are still some hurdles to overcome, this is a major step forward for the legalization of sports betting in Germany. Supporters of the bill believe that it will create more jobs and generate more tax revenue for the government.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased addiction rates and organized crime. However, many experts believe that these risks can be mitigated with proper regulation.

It will be interesting to see how this issue plays out in Germany over the coming months and years. In any case, the legalization of sports betting is a major development in the global gambling landscape.

#  Legalization of sports betting in Germany moves ahead!

On Thursday, the German parliament voted in favor of legalizing sports betting in the country. This move comes as a bit of a surprise as the bill had been met with strong resistance from the country’s football association, Deutsche Fußball Liga (DFL), which argued that it would lead to match-fixing and other forms of corruption in the sport.

Despite these concerns, the bill was approved by 463 votes to 36, with one abstention. It now goes to the upper house of parliament for final approval, but this is seen as a formality.

Under the new law, operators will have to pay a license fee of €10 million and will be limited to offering bets on football and other sports. The DFL will receive a fixed percentage of gross gaming revenue from these operators – around 5%.

This is not the first time that Germany has attempted to legalize sports betting. A previous attempt in 2012 was overturned by the Federal Constitutional Court on the grounds that it violated state sovereignty. However, this latest bill has been amended to address these concerns.

It is expected that sports betting will be legalized in Germany by early 2019.

#  German Parliament approves sports betting legalization!

On July 12, 2017, the German Bundestag (parliament) has approved the legalisation of sports betting. The new law will come into effect in January 2018 and will allow both state-owned and private sports betting providers to operate in the country.

The previous legislation, which dated back to 2008, had been criticised for being too restrictive and not doing enough to protect consumers. The new law is designed to address these concerns and is expected to generate an additional €44 million in tax revenue each year.

In order to apply for a licence, operators will have to pay a fee of €500,000, with an annual licence renewal cost of €250,000. All operators will be required to contribute a percentage of their gross gaming revenue to a fund that will be used to combat match-fixing and other illegal activities in the sport industry.

The move is seen as a victory for the gambling industry, which has been lobbying for liberalisation for many years. However, it is also likely to be welcomed by consumers, who will now have a wider choice of sports betting providers from which to choose.
