#  Curie to Open Its Doors in October!

As we gear up for the opening of Curie in October, we cannot help but be excited about all of the possibilities this new space will bring to the robotics and AI communities in Boston. Located in the heart of downtown, Curie will be a place where people from all backgrounds can come together to learn, share ideas, and build robots and AI applications.

The facility will include laboratory space, classrooms, meeting rooms, and a fabrication lab. In addition, Curie will offer memberships to individuals and organizations, making it possible for everyone from students to companies to explore robotics and AI.

We are already seeing interest from the local community in Curie; several classes and workshops have been scheduled for the opening month. These include an Introduction to Robotics class for high school students, a workshop on how to build your own chatbot, and a session on using machine learning techniques for predictive maintenance.

In addition to these inaugural classes, we are also working with our partners at Project Lead The Way (PLTW) to develop a robotics curriculum specifically for high schools. This curriculum will be available at no cost to any school that wants to use it.

Curie is open not just to Bostonians but also to people from around the world. We want it to be a place where people can come together to exchange ideas and collaborate on projects. We think that by bringing people together we can create something truly special—a community of robotics and AI enthusiasts who are passionate about building cool stuff!
