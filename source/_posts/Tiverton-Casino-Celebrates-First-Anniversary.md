#  Tiverton Casino Celebrates First Anniversary

The Tiverton Casino Resort is celebrating its first anniversary this weekend. The resort, which is Rhode Island’s only casino, has been a major hit since it opened last year.

According to officials at the casino, the resort has been a big success. In the first year alone, Tiverton Casino Resort has generated over $240 million in revenue for the state of Rhode Island.

The Tiverton Casino Resort is not just a casino; it is also a resort hotel. It features 350 rooms and suites, as well as a spa and several restaurants. There is also a golf course on site.

The resort is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It offers something for everyone, from those who enjoy playing blackjack or slots to those who just want to relax by the pool or spa.
