There was a reported armed robbery at the casino Genii in which $10,000 was stolen from the safe. The incident occurred on Sunday night at around 10 pm when two men, both carrying firearms, entered the casino and demanded money from the staff.

The robbers got away with a substantial amount of cash and are still at large. This incident is yet another reminder of the dangers that casinos face from criminal activity. Although security measures are in place, there is always a potential for robberies to take place.

This particular robbery has caused a lot of concern among casino operators as it is one of the largest amount of money to be stolen in such an incident. It is hoped that the police will be able to apprehend the perpetrators soon and return the money to the casino.

#  Casino employees help catch armed robbers in action

On Tuesday, January 22, two armed robbers entered the Casino du Liban and attempted to steal money from the casino’s employees. However, the quick thinking of the casino employees working that night helped to apprehend the robbers and prevent them from stealing any money.

The two robbers, who were wearing masks, entered the casino and approached a group of employees. One of the robbers pulled out a gun and demanded that the employees hand over money. However, the employees refused to cooperate and instead began shouting for help. This alerted other casino employees, who came to help apprehend the robbers.

In the ensuing struggle, one of the robbers was able to escape but the other was apprehended by the casino security staff. The stolen money was also recovered.

This incident shows how important it is for businesses to have well-trained security staff who are prepared to respond quickly in dangerous situations. The casino employees’ quick thinking prevented a robbery from taking place and likely saved lives.

#  Tego and Vasto recount casino robbery experience

Two men, Tego and Vasto, recount their experience during a casino robbery. Both men were armed and held several people at gunpoint while they robbed the casino.

"I can't believe how well it went," Tego says. "We walked in with our guns drawn and everyone just surrendered without a fight. It was like taking candy from a baby."

"Yeah, it was easy," Vasto agrees. "But I didn't like all the innocent people being put at risk. If anything had gone wrong, it would have been on our heads."

Despite the potential danger, both men feel that the robbery was a success. They got away with a large sum of money and no one was hurt.

"I'm just glad it's over," Vasto says. "I don't want to do this again."

"Me too," Tego agrees. "But I'll definitely be ready if something comes up."

#  Armed robbers still at large after targeting casino Genii

Police are still searching for the armed robbers who targeted the Genii casino on Saturday night.

The masked men entered the casino at around 10pm, wielding firearms and making threats to staff and guests. They proceeded to rob the casino of an undisclosed amount of money before fleeing the scene.

No one was injured in the incident, but staff and guests were left shaken by the ordeal.

A police spokesperson said that they are following several leads and are confident of catching the perpetrators soon. However, they urged anyone with information about the robbery to come forward.

This is not the first time that Genii has been targeted by criminals. In November last year, two men robbed the casino of over $100,000 in cash and chips.

The owners of Genii have previously spoken out against increasing crime rates in Macau, and have called for more action to be taken to address the issue.
