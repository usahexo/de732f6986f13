#  Is the petition to legalize gambling in Florida really gaining traction?


Gambling has been around for centuries. People have enjoyed gambling for the thrill, excitement, and occasional monetary winnings it provides. Recreational gambling is legal in many parts of the United States, but there are still some states where it is not allowed. Florida is one of those states.

There have been several attempts over the years to legalize gambling in Florida, but they have all failed. Now, there is a new petition circulating that is aimed at legalizing gambling in Florida. The petition calls for the legalization of casino-style gambling, including slot machines and table games. It also calls for the repeal of the state’s prohibition against pari-mutuel wagering on horse and dog races.

The petition was created by the Florida Gaming Association (FGA), a group that represents the interests of the state’s casino operators. The FGA says that legalizing gambling in Florida would generate $2 billion in tax revenue each year and create more than 30,000 jobs.

So far, the petition has received little support. Only about 2,000 people have signed it so far. This is most likely due to the fact that there is strong opposition to legalized gambling in Florida from many groups, including religious organizations and charities. They argue that legalized gambling will only lead to more addiction and poverty.

Despite this opposition, the FGA plans to continue pushing for legalization. They believe that with enough public support, they can convince lawmakers to change the laws and allow casinos in Florida.

#  Casino lobbyists gear up for gambling petition in Florida

The casino industry is gearing up for a gambling petition in Florida, as the state’s lawmakers consider expanding gambling options.

Lobbyists for the casino industry have been meeting with legislators, urging them to approve a measure that would allow for large resorts with full-scale casinos. The bill has already won approval from two committees in the House of Representatives.

Gambling opponents, including Disney, are fighting the measure, saying that it will hurt tourism in the state. They argue that allowing more casinos will also lead to an increase in problem gambling.

Casino lobbyists, however, insist that the measure will create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the state. They are hopeful that it will be approved before the end of the legislative session later this month.

#  Gambling petition in Florida could bring casino resorts to the Sunshine State

A proposed gambling petition in the state of Florida could have major implications for casino resorts in the Sunshine State. The petition, which has been drafted by the Florida Gambling Association (FGA), is seeking to add a referendum question to the state’s November ballot that would allow voters to decide whether or not they want casino resorts added to Florida’s gambling landscape.

According to FGA’s president, arcade tycoon Tom Potter, the goal of the petition is two-fold: first, to give Florida voters the opportunity to make their voices heard on the issue of gambling expansion; and second, to create jobs and generate economic growth in the state. “It is our hope that this amendment will pass and bring much needed jobs and revenue to our local communities, as well as save our struggling schools and hospitals,” said Potter.

Supporters of the proposed amendment argue that it would be a boon for tourism in Florida, generating an estimated $2 billion annually in new gaming revenue. They also maintain that it would create thousands of jobs throughout the state – particularly in economically depressed areas such as Central Florida – and that it would generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for local governments.

Critics of the amendment, however, contend that it could lead to increased crime and social ills, such as problem gambling. They also argue that casinos bring little economic benefit to states compared with other forms of tourism development; most of the profits from casinos end up going out of state.

If placed on the ballot and approved by Florida voters, the amendment would allow up to seven casino resorts to be built in designated areas around the state. The locations would be chosen by a five-member board appointed by the governor and legislature; at least one resort would be required to be located in each of Florida’s four congressional districts.

#  Is Florida ready for legalized gambling?

Florida has been in the news a lot lately, with the hotly contested US Senate election between incumbent Bill Nelson and Governor Rick Scott. As if that weren’t enough, there is also the question of whether or not Florida is ready for legalized gambling.

The idea of legalizing gambling in the Sunshine State has been around for a while. In fact, in 2011 then-Governor Rick Scott said that he was “open to the idea” of legalizing gambling. At the time, he was vague about what he had in mind, but it’s safe to assume that he was thinking about expanding gambling beyond casinos and slot machines into other areas such as poker and sports betting.

Fast-forward to 2018 and there is now a bill before the Florida legislature that would legalize internet poker. The bill, which was filed by State Senator Jeff Brandes, would allow people over the age of 21 to play poker online for real money. The bill has already passed one committee vote, and it could come up for a final vote as early as next month.

If this bill becomes law, it would make Florida the latest state to legalize internet poker. Other states that have legalized internet poker include New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Nevada.

As far as gambling goes, Florida is already a big player. The state has over 60 casinos, which generate more than $2 billion in annual revenue. In addition, there are over 1 million slot machines in Florida, which generate more than $7 billion in annual revenue.

Clearly, there is a lot of money to be made from gambling in Florida. The question is whether or not the state is ready for even more gambling?

One of the main arguments against legalizing gambling is that it can lead to addiction and other social problems. Gambling addiction can have a devastating impact on individuals and their families. In addition, legalized gambling can lead to increased crime rates and bankruptcy rates.

Another argument against legalizing gambling is that it can hurt businesses that are already operating in the state. For example, if Florida were to legalize internet poker, it would likely hurt the casino industry in the state since people would be able to gamble online instead of going to a casino.

On the other hand, supporters of legalized gambling argue that it can be a major source of revenue for the state government. They also argue that it can create jobs and help boost the economy. Additionally, they argue that legalized gambling can be safely regulated and monitored by the government.

So what does the future hold for legalized gambling in Florida? That remains to be seen. Clearly there are pros and cons on both sides of the argument. It will be up to lawmakers in Florida to decide what is best for the state

#  Petition to legalize gambling in Florida handed in to state officials

A petition to legalize gambling in the state of Florida has been handed in to officials, with proponents of the measure arguing that it could provide a major boost to the state’s economy. The petition, which has already gathered over 100,000 signatures, will now be considered by the state legislature.

If legalized, gambling would be limited to casinos and slot machines, and would not include sports betting. Proponents of the measure argue that it would generate jobs and tax revenue, while opponents claim that it would lead to increased problem gambling rates.

Florida is one of just a handful of states in the US where gambling is currently illegal. If the measure is approved by the state legislature, it will then be put to a public vote.
