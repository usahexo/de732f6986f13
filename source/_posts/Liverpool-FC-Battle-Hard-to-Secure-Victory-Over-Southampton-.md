#  Liverpool FC Battle Hard to Secure Victory Over Southampton 

Liverpool FC started the game brightly and took the lead after just nine minutes. Philippe Coutinho played a one-two with Sadio Mane before firing past Fraser Forster in the Southampton goal. The Reds continued to push and had a number of other chances but they couldn’t find a second goal. The Saints grew into the game as the first half went on and had a couple of good chances of their own, but Loris Karius was equal to them.

The second half was much more even, with both teams having chances, but it was Liverpool who found the crucial second goal. A wonderfully worked team goal, started by Roberto Firmino, found Mane in space in the box and he finished clinically to make it 2-0. Southampton pulled one back minutes later through Shane Long but Liverpool held on for the win.

It was a hard-fought victory for Liverpool and they will be pleased to have got all three points, especially as they were playing against a side who are currently in ninth place in the league. Jurgen Klopp will be hoping that this is the start of a good run of results which will see his side climb up the table and challenge for a Champions League spot.

Liverpool 1-0 Southampton

In a hard-fought game at Anfield, Liverpool got the edge over Southampton thanks to a goal from Daniel Sturridge. It was an evenly contested match for most of the 90 minutes, but Sturridge’s well-placed finish in the 73rd minute was enough to give the Reds all three points. Philippe Coutinho also played a part in the goal, setting up Sturridge with a perfect cross.

Southampton had their chances to equalize late on in the game, but Liverpool’s defense held firm. The win keeps Liverpool in fifth place in the Premier League table, just four points behind fourth-place Tottenham Hotspur. Next up for Liverpool is a home game against second-place Manchester City.

Liverpool were looking to get back to winning ways against a tough Arsenal side in front of their home fans. The Gunners have made a blistering start to the season and Jurgen Klopp would have been well aware of the threat they posed. It was Liverpool who started brighter, though, and they took the lead in the 37th minute courtesy of Adam Lallana. The midfielder met Philippe Coutinho's corner with a downward header that Petr Cech could only palm into his own net.

Arsenal came out fighting in the second period and had plenty of chances to get back into the game, but Liverpool held firm to take all three points. The victory moves them up to fifth in the table and leaves Arsenal in eighth.

Here are six talking points from the game:

1) It was a tight affair at Anfield with neither side able to create too many clear-cut chances. Liverpool were probably the better team overall and took their chance when it came.

2) Adam Lallana scored his first goal of the season with a well-taken header and it was just what Liverpool needed going into half-time. The midfielder has been in good form this season and will be looking to add more goals to his tally.

3) Arsenal had plenty of chances in the second half but they couldn't find a way past Loris Karius. The German goalkeeper has been in good form since taking over from Simon Mignolet and he produced some fine saves to keep Liverpool in front.

4) Mohamed Salah was lively throughout and caused problems for the Arsenal defence with his pace and movement. He came close to scoring on several occasions but was ultimately unable to find the net.

5) Granit Xhaka had an eventful game for Arsenal, picking up two yellow cards which means he will miss next weekend's game against Watford. He'll be sorry he didn't make more of an impact on the game as he looked dangerous going forward at times.

6) This was an important win for Liverpool which keeps them in touch with the top four going into the international break. They will be hoping to build on this result when they return to action against Manchester United at Old Trafford.

#  Roberto Firmino Finds the Net in Second Half as Reds Take Down Southampton 3-1 
Liverpool;s Roberto Firmino netted in the second half against Southampton and the Reds prevailed 3-1 at Anfield. Sadio Mane, Philippe Coutinho and Firmino all contributed to the tally sheet for Liverpool. For Southampton, Dusan Tadic tallied the lone goal.

The first half was end to end with both sides taking their chances. Liverpool opened up the scoring in the 25th minute as Mane hammered a shot past Fraser Forster from close range. The Saints equalized soon afterward as Tadic converted from the penalty spot after Dejan Lovren was adjudged to have fouled Shane Long. The first half ended 1-1.

Liverpool retook the lead in the 55th minute as Coutinho played a beautiful ball through to Firmino who slotted it home. Mane got his second of the match in injury time, curling a superb effort into the top corner to make it 3-1 and essentially seal all three points for Liverpool.

This victory moves Liverpool up to second in the table, just two points behind leaders Chelsea who have a game in hand. Southampton now sit tenth, just four points above the relegation zone.

#  Sadio Mane Scores Twice as Liverpool FC Triumph Over Southampton

Liverpool FC vindicated manager Jurgen Klopp's faith in them as they triumphed 2-0 against Southampton at Anfield on Saturday. The Reds, who have been inconsistent this season, started brightly with Sadio Mane scoring twice within the first twenty minutes of the game.

Mane's opener came in the eleventh minute as he converted a cross from Philippe Coutinho. The Senegalese international doubled Liverpool's lead in the eighteenth minute, slotting the ball past Fraser Forster after being put through by Roberto Firmino.

Liverpool nearly added a third goal before halftime but Adam Lallana's effort rattled the crossbar. The home side continued to dominate after the break and could have scored more but for some impressive saves from Fraser Forster. Southampton were unable to create any clear-cut chances and never looked like getting back into the game.

The victory means that Liverpool move up to fourth place in the Premier League table, just two points behind second-placed Tottenham Hotspur. With rivals Manchester United losing to Huddersfield Town earlier on Saturday, Liverpool will be looking to close the gap at the top of the table even further when they face Manchester City next weekend.
